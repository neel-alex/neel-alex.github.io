      I write hoping that you are stronger than me so that you can survive their wrath and wiser than me so that you do not act as prematurely as I have done because now my end is nigh as they know I know too much and have to be silenced but in the name of the village I serve I will not go without a fight.

      I am a member of the Order of the Hollow Shell which is a secret group that styles themselves the heritors of the First Kazekage's legacy and they are more cunning and ruthless than anyone else within the village and they do not use ninja alone to escape ANBU's net so beware them and do not let them know of you for they have eyes everywhere.

      The moon goddess is dead so I cannot explain why she speaks when she is full in the sky but I can explain that the sage was a fraud and a liar powerful enough to pull the entire continent under his sway but not enough to erase the truth of reality and he did a great many evil things but imprisoning Jashin was not among them.

      On the night of Gaara's birth Mahokomi Seiren whose mind had been broken by a sealing failure caused another and allowed the influence of a Being into the souls of five and fifty nearby people and I do not know whether it was the Bleeding One or the Voice that speaks to the Yodomi but it will be the cause of the downfall of Hidden Sand.

      Six is the true number and should be held sacred so so not let them fool you into thinking that Five is the sacred number for both Five Elements and Five Nations are lies and the Kage are the masters of those lies especially Sarutobi Hiruzen who even now tries to fulfill the grim work of the Sage Himself so you must cut down the Uchiha.

      I have joined the Conspiracy of Iron to learn about them and undermine them and only now realize they intend to kill me so know that they are the heart of evil within the village allied with Konoha's Root and Iwa's Black Diamond and I have hidden all that I know about them in a wooden box under the sand by the Great White Tiger's shrine.
